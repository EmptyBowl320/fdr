    <h2>The Child Hood of Franklin Delano Roosevelt</h2>
    <p> Franklin D. Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882 in Hyde Park, NY. Rooselvelt was born into a wealthy family as the
        only child of James Rooselvelt and Sara Ann Delano. He was surrounded by privilege and a sense of self-importance.
        In 1819, he attended Groton School for boys in Massachussets. He did not fit in with the other students because Groton
        men excelled in athletic and Rooselvelt did not, he strived to please the adults. After graduating from Groton in
        1900, Rooselvelt entered Harvard University. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, editor of the Harvard
        Crimson Newspaper and received his degree in only three years, even though he was only a "C" student. Rooselvelt
        went on to study law at Columbia University. Fot the next three years, he practiced law in New York, but found law
        practice boring. He set his sights on bigger accomplishments.
